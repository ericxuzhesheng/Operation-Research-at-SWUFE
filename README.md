# Operations Research at SWUFE

This repository contains comprehensive materials for the **Operations Research** course at the **Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE)**.  
It is designed to equip students with both **theoretical foundations** and **practical skills** in optimization, decision-making, and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Main Learning Topics

The course covers a broad spectrum of operations research areas, including:

1. **Foundations and Tools**

   - **Intro to Python**: Programming basics for data handling, computation, and visualization.
   - **Hands-on Gurobi**: Modeling and solving optimization problems using a state-of-the-art solver.
   - **Mathematical Foundations**: Linear programming and integer programming formulation and solution methods.

2. **Optimization Applications**

   - **Portfolio Optimization**: Mathematical modeling for financial decision-making and risk-return trade-offs.
   - **Facility Location**: Strategic planning for optimal facility placement to minimize cost and maximize efficiency.
   - **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Classic combinatorial optimization problem and its variants.
   - **Graph and Network Optimization**: Shortest paths, maximum flow, and network design.

3. **Heuristic and AI-Based Methods**

   - **Heuristics & Metaheuristics**: Greedy algorithms, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms for large-scale optimization.
   - **Sudoku Solver**: Applying constraint programming and optimization to logic puzzles.
   - **Game Theory**: Strategic decision-making in competitive and cooperative environments.

4. **Problem-Solving Skills**
   - Mathematical modeling from real-world scenarios.
   - Translating problems into formal optimization models.
   - Using computational tools to implement and solve problems.
